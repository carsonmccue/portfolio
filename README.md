I chose to use SvelteKit (another framework similar to NextJS) and Cloudflare Pages (another provider similar to Vercel). I'm personally a big fan of these. Because this is a portfolio project I'm probably going to keep updating, I wanted to use the technologies I enjoy working with the most and which provide me the most flexibility.
